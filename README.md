## Project name and origin
In late 2015/early 2016, a much smaller program called "websh" was born that only offered basic shell access via SMS and
telephone. The laitos project evolved from the smaller program, restarted from scratch in late 2016, and throughout
2017 the project gained a full suite of web servers along with powerful social network apps as well as utility apps.

Finland is my favourite country and a good Finnish friend on IRC by the name of "zutt" recommended Finnish word "laitos"
(meaning institute, apparently) to replace the old name "websh". I do not understand the rationale, but it
sounds cute enough to name a project.
