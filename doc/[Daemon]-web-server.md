## Introduction
The web server hosts a static personal website that consists of:
- A home page in an HTML file.
- Media files and other assets in directories.

The web server also hosts specialised web services such as telephone/SMS web hook, desktop-on-a-page, check out
[Components - rich web services](https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/laitos/wiki/Component-list#rich-web-services) to explore and enable then.

## Configuration
Construct the following JSON object and place it under JSON key `HTTPDaemon` in configuration file:
<table>
<tr>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
    <th>Default value</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Address</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>The address network to listen on.</td>
    <td>"0.0.0.0" - listen on all network interfaces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Port</td>
    <td>integer</td>
    <td>Port number to listen on. It is usually 443 for TLS-enabled server, or 80 for non-TLS server.</td>
    <td>443 (if TLS is enabled) or 80 (if TLS is not enabled)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>PerIPLimit</td>
    <td>integer</td>
    <td>
        Maximum number of visits a visitor (identified by IP) may make in a second.
        <br/>
        The number acts as a multiplier in initialising rate limit of file, directory, and web service access.
    </td>
    <td> 12 - resonable for a personal website</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>ServeDirectories</td>
    <td>{"/the/url/location": "/path/to/directory"...}</td>
    <td>Serve the directories at the specified URL location. The prefix slash in URL location string is mandatory.</td>
    <td>(Not used by default)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>TLSCertPath</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>
        Absolute or relative path to PEM-encoded TLS certificate file.
        <br/>
        The file may contain a certificate chain with server certificate on top and CA authority toward bottom.
    </td>
    <td>(Not enabled by default)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>TLSKeyPath</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Absolute or relative path to PEM-encoded TLS certificate key.</td>
    <td>(Not enabled by default)</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Host home page (index page)
To host a home page, place the following things under JSON key `HTTPHandlers` in configuration file:

- String array `IndexEndpoints` - URL locations that will serve home page; in most cases it should be:

      ["/", "/index.html"]

  The prefix slash is mandatory.
- Object `IndexEndpointConfig` that comes with the following mandatory attributes:
<table>
<tr>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>HTMLFilePath</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Path to HTML home page file.</td>
</tr>
</table>


### Example
Here is an example setup that hosts a home page and media files:
<pre>
{
    ...

    "HTTPDaemon": {
        "TLSCertPath": "howard-dot-net.crt",
        "TLSKeyPath": "howard-dot-net.key",
        "ServeDirectories": {
            "/media/videos": "/home/howard/CoolVideos",
            "/site/img": "/home/howard/WebsiteImages",
            "/site/css": "/home/howard/WebsiteCSS",
            "/site/js": "/home/howard/WebsiteJavascript"
        }
    },
    "HTTPHandlers": {
        ...

        "IndexEndpointConfig": {
            "HTMLFilePath": "index.html"
        },
        "IndexEndpoints": ["/", "/index.html"],

        ...
    },

    ...
}
</pre>

## Run
Tell laitos to run HTTPS web server in the command line:

    sudo ./laitos -config <CONFIG FILE> -daemons ...,httpd,...

Tell laitos to run plain HTTP web server in the command line:

    sudo ./laitos -config <CONFIG FILE> -daemons ...,insecurehttpd,...

Both HTTPS and HTTP web servers can run simultaneously, they share the same configuration, pages, and API endpoints:

    sudo ./laitos -config <CONFIG FILE> -daemons ...,httpd,insecurehttpd,...

## Deployment
In order for an Internet user to browse your website hosted via laitos:
1. Your domain names must be covered by a DNS hosting service. If the concept sounds unfamiliar, check out this article
    from Amazon Web Service: [What is DNS](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/what-is-dns/).
2. DNS hosting providers usually charge ~ 1 USD per domain per month. If you are looking for a provider, check out:
   - [Amazon Web Service "Route53"](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)
   - [Google Cloud Platform "Cloud DNS"](https://cloud.google.com/dns/)
3. Check at your Domain Registrar that the domain name servers are pointing to DNS hosting providers.
4. If you are making changes to domain name servers, it may take up to 24 hours to propagate through the Internet.

Now, create or modify a DNS "A" entry for your domain name. The entry must look like:

- DNS name: `my-domain-name.net`
- Record type: `A`
- Time to live (TTL): leave at default or `5 minutes`
- Value (preference and mail server): the public IP address of laitos server

Here is an example involving two domain names and one sub-domain, assuming that laitos server is on `58.169.236.112`:

<table>
<tr>
    <th>DNS name</th>
    <th>Record type</th>
    <th>Time to live (TTL)</th>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Remark</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>howard-homepage.net</td>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>5 minutes</td>
    <td>58.169.236.112</td>
    <td>First example</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>howard-blog.org</td>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>5 minutes</td>
    <td>58.169.236.112</td>
    <td>Second example</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>cool.howard-blog.org</td>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>5 minutes</td>
    <td>58.169.236.112</td>
    <td>A sub-domain of second example</td>
</tr>
</table>

Wait up to an hour for new DNS records to propagate through the Internet.

## Test
Use a web browser to visit laitos web server on your domain name, pay special attention to these items:
- If TLS is enabled, connect to web server via HTTPS, and browser should recognise the TLS certificate.
- Visit home page locations.
- Visit file directories - it is normal for browser to see a directory file listing page.
- If plain HTTP daemon is enabled, check home page and file directories on HTTP port 80 as well.

## Tips
- The home page HTML is slightly processed in this way:
   - `#LAITOS_CLIENTADDR` is substituted to visitor's IP address.
   - `#LAITOS_3339TIME` is substituted to current system date and time.

   For example, the following HTML snippet:

       <p>Welcome, visitor! Your IP is #LAITOS_CLIENTADDR and the time is now #LAITOS_3339TIME.</p>

   Will be rendered as (IP and time are examples):

       <p>Welcome, visitor! Your IP is 41.156.72.9 and the time is now 2017-08-22T15:04:05Z07:00</p>
- If you wish to take a closer look at the web server's performance over time and plot the graphs on a dashboard,
  check out the specialised web service [prometheus metrics exporter](https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/laitos/wiki/%5BWeb-service%5D-prometheus-metrics-exporter)
  which exports metrics many of laitos' components (including this web server daemon) to the popular open-source
  monitoring software [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
