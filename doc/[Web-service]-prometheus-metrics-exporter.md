## Introduction
Hosted by laitos [web server](https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/laitos/wiki/%5BDaemon%5D-web-server), the endpoint serves metrics
information collected from the following sources in the prometheus-exporter format:

- All web service handlers: time to first byte, processing duration, size of response.
- Program resource usage: CPU time consumed, number of context switches, time spent on run queue and wait queue.
- All web proxy requests: time to first byte, connection duration, size of response.

## Configuration
Under the JSON key `HTTPHandlers`, add a string property called `PrometheusMetricsEndpoint`, value being the URL location of the service.

Keep the location a secret to yourself and make it difficult to guess. Here is an example:
<pre>
{
    ...

    "HTTPHandlers": {
        ...

        "PrometheusMetricsEndpoint": "/my-precious-metrics",

        ...
    },

    ...
}
</pre>

## Run
Modify the laitos program launch command by adding the parameter `-prominteg` to it. The parameter works as the master switch to turn on
all points of integration with prometheus:

    sudo ./laitos -prominteg -config <CONFIG FILE> -daemons ...,httpd,...

The exporter is hosted by web server, therefore remember to [run web server](https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/laitos/wiki/%5BDaemon%5D-web-server#run).

## Usage
There are three categories of performance metrics exported by this web service:
- [Web server (httpd and insecurehttpd)](https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/laitos/wiki/%5BDaemon%5D-web-server) statistics are always included, such as
  individual handler's processing duration, response size, time-to-first-byte, etc.
- When you enable the [web proxy daemon](https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/laitos/wiki/%5BDaemon%5D-web-proxy), the exporter will automatically include
  statistics such as data transfer per proxy destination, number of connections, connection duration, etc.
- When you enable the [maintenance daemon](https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/laitos/wiki/%5BDaemon%5D-system-maintenance), the exporter will automatically
  include laitos program's process statistics such as CPU usage and scheduler performance. These stats rely on Linux (`procfs`).

Next, follow the installation instructions of [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/) to install and start the
prometheus daemon. Feel free to run the daemon on a home desktop, a dedicated server, or on the same computer that runs laitos.

Edit the prometheus configuration file (often located at `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`) and tell it to periodically fetch the exported data from
the web service's endpoint:

<pre>
...
scrape_configs:
    - job_name: 'laitos'
      scrape_interval: 20s
      scrape_timeout: 5s
      scheme: https # or https
      metrics_path: '/my-precious-metrics'
      static_configs:
          - targets: ['laitos-server.example.com:443', 'another-laitos-server.example.com:443]
</pre>

## Tips
Visit prometheus web UI (or Grafana dashboard if they are integrated), and try out the following equations for plotting program resource usage:
- Percentage of involuntary context switches, 3-minutes running average:
  `(sum(rate(laitos_proc_num_involuntary_switches[3m])) by (instance) / (sum(rate(laitos_proc_num_involuntary_switches[3m])) by (instance) + sum(rate(laitos_proc_num_voluntary_switches[3m])) by (instance))) * 100`
- Seconds of CPU time spent by laitos server (including children) in user and kernel mode, 3-minutes running average:
  `sum(rate(laitos_proc_num_kernel_mode_sec_incl_children[3m]) + rate(laitos_proc_num_user_mode_sec_incl_children[3m])) by (instance)`
- Percentage of time spent as runnable according to OS scheduler (higher is better), 3-minutes running average:
  `(sum(rate(laitos_proc_num_run_sec[3m])) by (instance) / (sum(rate(laitos_proc_num_run_sec[3m])) by (instance) + sum(rate(laitos_proc_num_wait_sec[3m])) by (instance))) * 100`

And try out these for plotting web server stats:
- Time-to-first-byte across all handlers at 95% quantile, 3-minutes running average:
  `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(laitos_httpd_response_time_to_first_byte_seconds_bucket[3m])) by (le, instance))`
- Processing duration (including IO) across all handlers at 95% quantile, 3-minutes running average:
  `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(laitos_httpd_handler_duration_seconds_bucket[3m])) by (le, instance))`
- Size of HTTP response across all handlers at 95% quantile, 3-minutes running average:
  `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(laitos_httpd_response_size_bytes_bucket[3m])) by (le, instance))`

And try out these for plotting web proxy stats:
- Number of proxy requests per minute, 1-minute running average:
  `sum(rate(laitos_httpproxy_response_size_bytes_count[1m])) by (instance)`
- Bytes transferred to proxy clients per minute, 1-minute running average:
  `sum(rate(laitos_httpproxy_response_size_bytes_sum[1m])) by (instance)`
- Top 10 proxy destinations by data transfer (total MBs over 3hrs):
  `topk(10, sum by (host) (rate(laitos_httpproxy_response_size_bytes_sum[180m]))) * 180 * 60 / 1048576`
- Top 10 proxy destinations by num of connections (total over 3 hours):
  `topk(10, sum by (host) (rate(laitos_httpproxy_response_size_bytes_count[180m]))) * 180 * 60`
- Top 10 proxy destinations by connection duration (total seconds over 3 hours):
  `topk(10, sum by (host) (rate(laitos_httpproxy_handler_duration_seconds_sum[180m]))) * 180 * 60`
- Size of proxy response across all destinations at 90% quantile, 3-minutes running average:
  `histogram_quantile(0.90, sum(rate(laitos_httpproxy_response_size_bytes_bucket[3m])) by (le, instance))`
- Time-to-first-byte across all proxy destinations at 50% quantile, 3-minutes running average:
  `histogram_quantile(0.50, sum(rate(laitos_httpproxy_response_time_to_first_byte_seconds_bucket[3m])) by (le, instance))`
- Processing duration (including IO) across all proxy destinations at 50% quantile, 3-minutes running average:
  `histogram_quantile(0.50, sum(rate(laitos_httpproxy_handler_duration_seconds_bucket[3m])) by (le, instance))`

## Tips
- Make the endpoint difficult to guess, this helps to prevent misuse of the service.
